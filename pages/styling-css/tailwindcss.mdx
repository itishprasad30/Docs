# Tailwind CSS

In Tailwind CSS v2 there is a feature called JIT Compiler that speeds up the compilation process.

Here is a basic structure of a page that I usually use with Next.js and Tailwind CSS

```jsx
import * as React from 'react'
import Seo from '@/components/Seo'

export default function PageName() {
  return (
    <>
      <Seo templateTitle="Page Name" />

      <main>
        <section className="">
          <div className="layout"></div>
        </section>
      </main>
    </>
  )
}
```

## Layout Class

This is not Tailwind CSS specific, I also use this for projects with Vanilla CSS.

```css
.layout {
  /* 1100px */
  max-width: 68.75rem;
  @apply w-11/12 mx-auto;
}

/* or without Tailwind CSS */

.layout {
  max-width: 68.75rem;
  margin: 0 auto;
  width: 90%;
}
```

Here is some preview of what it does:

## Utilize Framework & Library

Tailwind CSS classnames can get ugly, especially when we have a lot of repeated classes. So, it is useful to use Framework such as React to make it into components.

I also use a library called [clsx](https://npm.im/clsx) to make it easier to use build variants on components, also grouping classnames into functionality.

For example:

```jsx
import clsx from 'clsx'

export default function Button({
  children,
  className = '',
  variants = 'primary',
  ...rest
}) {
  return (
    <button
      {...rest}
      className={clsx(
        'py-2 px-4 rounded font-bold hover:text-primary-400 animated-underline',
        'border border-gray-600',
        'focus:outline-none focus-visible:text-primary-400',
        {
          'bg-dark text-white': variants === 'primary',
          'bg-white text-dark hover:bg-gray-200 hover:text-dark focus-visible:text-dark':
            variants === 'secondary',
        },
        className
      )}
    >
      {children}
    </button>
  )
}
```
